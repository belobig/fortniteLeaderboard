Return of the Pixelated Pythons – Project 2 Proposal
Project Name: Fornite Leaderboard
Background is a video
Create a gaming statistics app that tracks scores and stats of users and compares them together
Connect with a Fortnite API
Use Sequelize as our ORM
Use GET and POST routes, possibly DELETE as well
Use MySQL DB with JAWS_DB, Deployed on Heroku, storing user nicknames, stats, etc.
New tech: Fortnite API, Fiddler 4 (for tracking web traffic), Chart.js for stats graphs, Materialize for CSS library
Use the MVC paradigm
Store sensitive info, such as API keys in .env file
Use Handlebars for Templating
May use authentication, if we get everything else working in time - try to use EPIC Games Authentication
Use public dataset from Fortnite Tracker API
Migration Strategy:
Use package.json to track packages
Use GitHub branches to collaborate

Future Enhancements:
Support additional platforms; XB1, PSN
Testing Framework:
Use Sequelize’s Mock
Use Mocha
Use Chai
